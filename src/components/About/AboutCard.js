            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Vishal Singh Adhikari</span> from <span className="purple">Dehradun, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently seeking new opportunities in web development, with a focus on frontend development and ReactJS. I have completed a BTech in Computer Science from Graphic Era Hill University.
            <br />
            I have worked on a project related to cryptocurrency details and another project focused on building a real estate application. Both projects showcase my hands-on experience with modern web technologies and frameworks.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing Cricket
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Travelling
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ color: "rgb(155 126 172)" }}>
            "Code with passion, create with purpose!"{" "}
